Task 4: Sentiment Analysis Using NLP

Project Title: Sentiment Analysis of Text Reviews Using TextBlob

Description of What I Did:

For Task 4, I performed sentiment analysis on a small set of text reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal was to analyze whether each review is Positive, Negative, or Neutral. I used a Python library called TextBlob to make this task simple and beginner-friendly.

Tools and Technologies Used:

Python (via Anaconda)

Jupyter Notebook

pandas

TextBlob

Sample dataset of text reviews

Steps I Followed:

Installed TextBlob using !pip install textblob.

Created or loaded a CSV file with short text reviews (e.g., "I love this product").

Loaded the data in Jupyter using pandas.

Applied TextBlob to each review to get its sentiment score (polarity).

Classified reviews into Positive, Negative, or Neutral based on the score.

Displayed the results in a table.

Output:

The output was a table that showed each review, its sentiment score, and its classification. Here's an example from my results:

Text	Polarity	Sentiment

I love this product	0.50	Positive

This is terrible	-1.00	Negative

It's okay, nothing special	0.00	Neutral
